# Project Title: Multi-API Application Generator

## Overview

This project is an advanced application generator that leverages both the OpenAI API and Anthropic's Claude API to create various types of applications. The project takes user input specifying the type of application to generate and any specific requirements, generates a file structure, and populates the files with appropriate content. The generated files are then packaged into a ZIP archive.

## Features
These are still under development and will be updated accordinly
